1. Take ½ tablespoon sabja seeds (sweet basil seeds) in a bowl. You can check for some husks or stones if any and remove them. Chia seeds can be added as a substitute for sweet basil seeds.

2. Then add water and stir.

3. Soak the sabja seeds in the water for about 20 to 30 mins.

4. After 30 minutes, you will see the sabja seeds fully soaked and will look gelatinous.

5. Using a fine strainer drain the extra water from the sabja seeds. Cover and keep the soaked sabja seeds aside.

Cooking falooda sev

6. Meanwhile, begin to prepare the faluda sev according to package instructions. Some require just soaking the falooda sev in warm water. I had to cook them in boiling water much like noodles. So I heated up 1.5 cups water and let it come to a boil.

7. Then added 5 tablespoons sev (roughly ⅓ cup). If the faluda sev are long, then just chop them before cooking. The ones I had got, were already small sized.

8. Boil them in the water on medium flame till they are softened.

9. They need to be cooked well.

10. Once they are cooked well, then strain them and drain the water. Rinse them in running water and keep aside. This removes the extra starch. Cover and let the faluda sev cool completely at room temperature.

11. Chop the nuts that you will be adding. I have added some cashews, almonds and pistachios. Raisins can be kept whole. You can rinse the nuts and raisins in water if you want, before chopping them. That’s what I do always when using nuts and dry fruits.

Making falooda

12. In about 4 tall serving glasses each, add the rose syrup first. You can add about 1.5 to 2 tablespoons rose syrup depending on your taste as well as the size of the glass.

13. Then add 2 tablespoons of the soaked sabja seeds.

14. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the falooda sev. After adding falooda sev, you can add jelly if you are using it.

15. Add about 1 cup chilled milk in a slow stream taking care that the milk does not mix with the rose syrup and the sabja seeds. The layers have to be visible and that is what makes the falooda visually appealing.

16. Finally add a scoop of vanilla ice cream or pista ice cream or mango ice cream or malai kulfi.

17. Top with sliced pistachios, golden raisins and sliced almonds.

18. Serve falooda with ice cream immediately. the remaining soaked basil seeds and sev can be kept in the refrigerator and stays well for a couple of days.Soaked sabja seeds can be added to lemon based drinks, rose-based drinks, any sherbet or even just plain water or chilled milk. While drinking falooda, with a spoon mix the rose syrup settled at the bottom with the milk and then drink.
